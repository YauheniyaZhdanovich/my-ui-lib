npm i => npm run storybook

the storybook service has started

We can see all the component we created story for on the page

With comments we can make generated documentation tab very imformative

Take a good look for the top panel that has Canvas/Documentation tabs

We can speed up the development with tools like themeing(dark-light), set of sizes(also portrait-landscape options), sizing tool

nice tool for debagging - addon was not added in the example, but can be very useful
